## Invensense MPU-9250 SPI Library

Library to interface with Invensense MPU-9250 9-DOF IMU using the SPI protocol. Tested on Arduino 1.0.6 and 1.6.3 (but should work with any newer version).

*Does not* use the built in DMP of the IMU; only reads raw data.

**What works**
- Gyro
- Accelerometer
- Magnetometer?
